conjugate coding problem

## It was a pleasure completing this assignment. 

## This project was bootstrapped with npm.

1.) set up node locally
2.) clone and navigate to /
3.) run tsc the retranspile from src directory
4.) run the js built to /build directory in any repl

## Project is already built. you can just grab index.js from /build if not intrested in typescript or bootstrap
